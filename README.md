# Zomato-order-data-analysis

I created an SQL project to analyze the orders made by regular Zomato users and those with premium memberships. 
This helps gain insights into business growth and promotional schemes. 
Analyzing user data through SQL provides a deeper understanding of customer preferences, enabling the company to enhance customer satisfaction and boost revenue. 
In simpler terms, SQL acts as the behind-the-scenes tool that empowers businesses to compete effectively in the market.
